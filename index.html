    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a container that has a pressure plate that opens a pipe later on the bottom, and another open pipe a little higher.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>
      We were testing a black box that didnâ€™t show itself how it worked. We thought it was 2 pipes, due to the fact that nothing came out the first trial, but in later trials there was almost quadruple the amount of output water from the input water. We think that there is a container that holds all the water, and a pipe is on the top. That's how the first trial occurred. The next trial, the water got inside the pipe, and water came out of the box. Then the 2nd pipe opened up, and more water came out of there.
    </p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>
      Why our model works is because there has to be something that opens up in later trials, or else the 5th trial would be inaccurate.
    </p>
    <h2>Why does our model work?</h2>
    <p>
     The reason why models are useful is because during our build models, we see trial and error on these models. We can see what went wrong with our model, then revise it.
    </p>
    <h1>Counterclaim</h1>
    <p>
      There also could have been another basket that stores half the water, and then later spit the water out. But this claim could've been false, due to more than half of the water exiting the water, in the first trails. We thought there was a 2nd pipe that opened up instead of a 2nd basket because the pipe can open up while more than half the water exiting out.
