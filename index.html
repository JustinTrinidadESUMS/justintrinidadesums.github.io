    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a container that has a pressure plate that opens a pipe later on the bottom, and another open pipe a little higher.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>
      We were testing a black box that didnâ€™t show itself how it worked. We thought it was 2 pipes, due to the fact that nothing came out the first trial, but in later trials there was almost quadruple the amount of output water from the input water. We think that there is a container that holds all the water, and a pipe is on the top. That's how the first trial occurred. The next trial, the water got inside the pipe, and water came out of the box. Then the 2nd pipe opened up, and more water came out of there.
    </p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>
      Why our model works is because there has to be something that opens up in later trials, or else the 5th trial would be inaccurate.
